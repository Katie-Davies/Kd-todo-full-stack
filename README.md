# TODO App

For this challenge, we will build a todo app (which is a common way to practice a new technology), using the full stack! From the database to the server, the API client, React and React Query, this app will ask you to use everything you've learned.



## Back end (Server-side)

### 1. Building the database

- [ ] Design a database to store a list of tasks, e.g. task details, priority, completed yes/no
- [ ] Build the migrations and seed data

### 2. Building the API

- [ ] Build an API (back end route) to get the information from your database (list, add, update and delete)
- [ ] Test your API with Insomnia

## Front end (Client-side)

### 3. Setting the stage

- [ ] Build a React component with static html
- [ ] Follow the [design](./public/designs/index.html) template for classNames and html element layout

### 4. Building the API client

- [ ] Build API client in the front end

### 5. Querying Data 

- [ ] Write a query with the `useQuery` hook to fetch the task data from the API
- [ ] Mutate data with the `useMutation` hook to create, update, and delete task data via the API
